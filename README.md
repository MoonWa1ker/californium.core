Californium (Cf) CoAP framework
===============================

Implements [RFC7252](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252)

Californium is a Java CoAP implementation for IoT Cloud services.
Thus, the focus is on scalability and usability instead of resource-efficiency
like for embedded devices. Yet Californium is also suitable for embedded JVMs.
